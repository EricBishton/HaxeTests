This is a random set of files that I use for testing the Haxe plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

This project does NOT compile.  There are many files that are
demonstrative of current or past bugs in the code.

The files in the src/plugintestsrc directory are duplicates of
tests in the test harness for the plugin.  They are here simply
because it's easier to debug in the running IDE in most cases
than to debug running test cases.

Many users have submitted code snippets that show one error or
another, and those are in src/name directories, or show up in the 
TestIssue*num*[_*description*].hx files.

Sources in the src/unit directory are unit test files from the
Haxe compiler's test suite.
